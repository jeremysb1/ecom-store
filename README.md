## About the project 

I built an E-commerce store to teach myself React. 

## Technologies Used
- Javascript
- React with Redux and Hooks
- Node.js
- Stripe Checkout API
- Firebase for Authentication (SSO)
- Firestore for NoSQL Database

## Why React

React enables developers to efficiencly create applications with resuable components. 

It also updates and renders the right components when the data changes while keeping state out of the DOM.
